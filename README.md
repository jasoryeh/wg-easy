</p>

## Features

* All-in-one: WireGuard + Web UI.
* Easy installation, simple to use.
* List, create, edit, delete clients.
* Show a client's QR code.
* Download a client's configuration file.
* Statistics for which clients are connected.
* Tx/Rx charts for each connected client.
* Client private keys are held on the client.

## Requirements

* A host with a kernel that supports WireGuard (all modern kernels).
* A host with Docker installed.

## Installation

### 1. Install Docker

If you haven't installed Docker yet, install it by running:

```bash
$ curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)
$ exit
```

And log in again.

### 2. Run WireGuard Easy

To automatically install & run wg-easy, simply run:

<pre>
$ docker run \
    --name=wg-easy \
    -p 51820:51820/udp \
    -e WG_PORT=51820 \
    -p 51821:51821/tcp \
    -e PORT=51821 \
    -v $PWD/mount/wireguard:/etc/wireguard \
    -e WG_HOST=$(curl checkip.amazonaws.com) \
    -e PASSWORD="your_secure_password_here!!" \
    --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
    --cap-add=SYS_MODULE \
    --sysctl=net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 \
    --sysctl=net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1 \
    --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    jasoryeh/wg-easy
</pre>

> ðŸ’¡ If your want to manually specify the server's public IP Address, replace `$(curl checkip.amazonaws.com) with a public facing IP address, a public domain pointing to the server, or a Dynamic Domain pointed at this server.
>
> ðŸ’¡  Replace `your_secure_password_here!!` with a different password!

The Web UI will now be available on `http://0.0.0.0:51821`.

## Options

These options can be configured by setting environment variables using `-e KEY="VALUE"` in the `docker run` command.

| Env | Default | Example | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `PASSWORD` | - | `foobar123` | When set, requires a password when logging in to the Web UI. |
| `WG_HOST` | - | `vpn.myserver.com` | The public hostname of your VPN server. |
| `WG_PORT` | `51820` | `12345` | The UDP port the actual Wireguard VPN server will listen to. |
| `PORT` | `51821` | `12345` | The port on which the Wireguard GUI will listen to. |
| `WG_INTERFACE` | `wg0` | `wg0` | Manually specify the interface name for the Wireguard server. |
| `WG_INTERNET_INTERFACE` | `wg0` | `wg0` | Manually specify the network interface that this application will attempt to configure for use with the Wireguard VPN server. |
| `WG_ADDRESS_SPACE` | `10.1.3.1/24` | `10.1.1.1/24` | Specify the address space that clients should use. |
| `WG_PRE_UP` | `...` | - | See [config.js](https://github.com/WeeJeWel/wg-easy/blob/master/src/config.js#L19) for the default value. |
| `WG_POST_UP` | `...` | `iptables ...` | See [config.js](https://github.com/WeeJeWel/wg-easy/blob/master/src/config.js#L20) for the default value. |
| `WG_PRE_DOWN` | `...` | - | See [config.js](https://github.com/WeeJeWel/wg-easy/blob/master/src/config.js#L27) for the default value. |
| `WG_POST_DOWN` | `...` | `iptables ...` | See [config.js](https://github.com/WeeJeWel/wg-easy/blob/master/src/config.js#L28) for the default value. |

... to be reimplemented:

| Env | Default | Example | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| `WG_MTU` | `null` | `1420` | The MTU the clients will use. Server uses default WG MTU. |
| `WG_PERSISTENT_KEEPALIVE` | `0` | `25` | Value in seconds to keep the "connection" open. If this value is 0, then connections won't be kept alive. |
| `WG_DEFAULT_ADDRESS` | `10.8.0.x` | `10.6.0.x` | Clients IP address range. |
| `WG_DEFAULT_DNS` | `1.1.1.1` | `8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4` | DNS server clients will use. |
| `WG_ALLOWED_IPS` | `0.0.0.0/0, ::/0` | `192.168.15.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24` | Allowed IPs clients will use. |

> If you change `WG_PORT`, make sure to also change the exposed port.

## Updating

To update to the latest version, simply run:

```bash
docker stop wg-easy
docker rm wg-easy
docker pull jasoryeh/wg-easy
```

And then run the `docker run -d \ ...` command above again.

## Contributor Brief
This section is intended as a briefing for contributors looking to contribute to this repository at `jasoryeh/wg-easy`.

### Notes
This application is intended to be run in a Docker container. This is a primarily Javascript application.

### Structure
This repository essentially contains two components of wg-easy, the web component and the server component. 

To summarize without extensively elaborating: 
* the **server** compoennt will actually (HTTP Requests -> wg-quick, wg, file IO, etc) interface with the Wireguard server; 
  * a `expressjs` node javascript application at its core
* the **web** component is purely the user interface and will attempt to perform as many operations as securely (and developmentally) feasible on the client side (essentially acting as the user entering wg commands).
  * a `vite` javascript web application at its core

### Running
To start up this application, the following must occur (in order):
1. Both the `web` and `server` components are initialized (npm install)
2. The `web`'s web components are built and a `dist` folder exists (npx vite build)
3. The `server` now starts up (npx nodemon)

This application is intended to be run from within a Docker container, the entrypoint is the `init.sh` script, this script does all of the above steps and is specific to the container only.

The recommended environment for developing is to develop in Docker. There are two scripts in the root directory intended to assist with development: `enter_dev.sh` and `dev.sh`.
* `enter_dev.sh`: builds the container associated with the `Dockerfile` and immediately launches it 
* `dev.sh`: To avoid changes on the host system from this app, do not run this on the host unless you would like to manage a server on the host, and instead run this in the container. It is intended to be run when you would like to simultaneously launch both the GUI server and the Wireguard VPN server.
